My name is Quadri, you can simply call me Sheggzie, preferably!
I am an aspiring Python developer/programmer.
I think coding is fun, only tiring if you encounter a bug, but yeah, be resilient, calm and try to fix it with help from online resources and you should be good :)
Thanks for reading this. Have fun. Bye :)
