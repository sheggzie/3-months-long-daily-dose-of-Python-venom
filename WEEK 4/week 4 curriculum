Fantastic job on completing Week 3! Let's move on to Week 4, where we'll focus on working with external libraries and APIs, which are essential skills for many real-world Python applications.

Week 4: Working with External Libraries and APIs

Day 1: Introduction to Libraries

Concepts:
Understanding what libraries are and why they are useful
Installing and importing libraries using pip

Tasks:
Install common libraries such as requests, pandas, and matplotlib.
Write simple scripts to import and use these libraries.

Example exercises:
Use the requests library to fetch data from a URL.
Create a simple DataFrame using the pandas library.

Day 2: Working with APIs

Concepts:
Understanding APIs and how to interact with them
Making HTTP requests using the requests library

Tasks:
Write scripts to interact with public APIs.

Example exercises:
Fetch weather data from a weather API and display it.
Retrieve data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, JSONPlaceholder) and process it.

Day 3: Data Analysis with Pandas

Concepts:
Using pandas for data manipulation and analysis
DataFrames, Series, and common operations (filtering, grouping, merging)

Tasks:
Write scripts to practice data manipulation using pandas.

Example exercises:
Load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame and perform basic operations.
Analyze a dataset by grouping and aggregating data.

Day 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Concepts:
Creating basic plots using matplotlib
Customizing plots (titles, labels, legends)

Tasks:
Write scripts to create various types of plots.

Example exercises:
Create a line plot of a dataset.
Generate a bar chart and customize its appearance.

Day 5: Advanced Data Visualization with Seaborn

Concepts:
Using seaborn for advanced data visualization
Creating statistical plots and visualizing complex relationships

Tasks:
Write scripts to create advanced plots using seaborn.

Example exercises:
Create a heatmap to visualize correlations in a dataset.
Generate a box plot to display distributions.

Day 6-7: Project - COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

Concepts:
Apply the concepts learned throughout the week.

Tasks:
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project:
Fetch COVID-19 data from a public API.
Perform data analysis using pandas.
Create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Steps:
Fetch COVID-19 data using the requests library.
Load the data into a pandas DataFrame and perform basic data cleaning.
Analyze the data to extract meaningful insights.
Create visualizations to display the insights.
