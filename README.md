I will be practicing and mastering Python daily for the next three months, starting today 24-6-2024 till 24-9-2024

BELOW IS THE APPROACH I WILL BE FOLLOWING:

I have consulted chatGPT to create a structure for me to follow for the next three months.

Great! I'll create a 3-month structured curriculum to help you become job-ready in Python, focusing on building projects to reinforce your skills. Each week will have a combination of learning new concepts and working on projects. Let's break it down:

Month 1: Core Concepts and Basic Projects

Week 2: Data Structures and File Handling

Concepts:
Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
File handling: reading from and writing to files.
Project:
Book Catalog: Create a program to manage a book catalog, allowing users to add, remove, search, and list books with file storage.
Week 3: Error Handling and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Concepts:
Exception handling with try, except, and finally.
Classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Project:
Bank Account System: Develop a simple bank account system that supports creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money.
Week 4: Advanced Data Structures and Libraries

Concepts:
Working with collections: deque, namedtuple, Counter from the collections module.
Introduction to libraries: NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
Project:
Student Grades Analysis: Use Pandas to read student grades from a CSV file and perform data analysis (average, median, standard deviation).
Month 2: Intermediate Topics and Larger Projects
Week 5: Web Scraping and APIs

Concepts:
Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and requests.
Working with APIs using requests.
Project:
Weather App: Create a CLI application that fetches and displays weather data for a given location using a weather API.
Week 6: Database Interaction

Concepts:
Introduction to SQL and databases.
Using SQLite with Python.
Project:
Personal Expense Tracker: Build an expense tracker that stores transactions in an SQLite database and provides summary reports.
Week 7: Web Development with Flask

Concepts:
Basics of Flask for web development.
Building routes, templates, and handling forms.
Project:
Blog Website: Create a simple blog website where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts.
Week 8: Advanced Flask and Authentication

Concepts:
User authentication and authorization.
Flask extensions (Flask-WTF, Flask-Login).
Project:
Blog Website (continued): Enhance the blog website by adding user registration, login, and comment functionality.
Month 3: Specialized Topics and Capstone Projects
Week 9: Data Science Basics

Concepts:
Introduction to data science and machine learning.
Data manipulation with Pandas.
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Project:
Sales Data Analysis: Analyze a dataset of sales transactions to derive insights and visualize the data.
Week 10: Machine Learning Introduction

Concepts:
Introduction to machine learning concepts.
Basics of Scikit-learn.
Project:
Simple Predictive Model: Build a simple predictive model (e.g., linear regression) using Scikit-learn and a relevant dataset.
Week 11: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning

Concepts:
More on machine learning algorithms: classification, clustering.
Model evaluation and validation.
Project:
Iris Classification: Implement a classification model to classify iris species using the famous Iris dataset.
Week 12: Capstone Project

Project:
Capstone Project: Choose a project that integrates multiple concepts learned over the past three months. Some ideas:
E-commerce Platform: A web application for managing products, users, and orders with a recommendation system.
Personal Finance Dashboard: A web application that tracks expenses, investments, and provides data visualizations and financial predictions.
Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiment from social media posts using NLP techniques and create visual reports.
General Tips:
Daily Practice: Dedicate at least 1-2 hours daily to coding.
Documentation: Regularly read official documentation and write comments in your code.
Version Control: Use Git to manage your projects.
Community Engagement: Participate in online forums, coding communities, and seek feedback.
Code Reviews: Regularly review your code and improve it based on feedback.
By following this curriculum and working diligently on the projects, you will gain the practical experience and confidence needed to apply for Python-related jobs.
